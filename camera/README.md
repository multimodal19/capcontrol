# camera

## Installation
This is based on a default installation of Python 3.7 (32-bit) on Windows, with
the Python distribution added to the PATH variable.

Since both `opencv-python` and `numpy` (which is a dependency) are available
as wheels for this version of Python, they can easily be installed with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
With the activated virtualenv, run `python camwindow.py`.
